\section{Problem Delimitation} \label{sec:problem-delimitation}

The Smart Home system developed in this project is a prototype trying to overcome some of the problems found in the use cases from \secref{sec:use-cases}. Due to the length of the project and limited resources, the project does not focus on building a complete Smart Home system.
Instead the focus is to solve the problems found in the use cases. As such, the project has the following limitation: 

\begin{description}
\item[Interoperability] The system will be developed to control smart devices from two different manufactures, to test whether this can be done or not.
\item[Usability] The project will not focus on the usability of the system, which means that no major design decisions or usability evaluation will be conducted.
\item[Decentralisation] The project's primary focus is decentralisation, to see whether or not this can be done.
\item[Security] The system will implement a simple user authentication system. 
\end{description}
