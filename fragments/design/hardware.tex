\section{Hardware}\label{sec:hardware}

To properly test the Smart Home system developed in this project, some kind of \sdevs~are needed. The following sections describes the chosen hardware which later will be used for implementation and testing purposes.


\subsection{Philips HUE}
Hue is a brand developed by Philips. Hue is a family of smart products for controlling the light sources. This includes various light bulbs, light switch, and lamps. The devices are connected to the Hue Hub, which is connected to the Internet. The Hue \sdevs~can be controlled from the official application on Android, iOS, and from an web application on the Hue homepage. Philips also provide a REST API, that provides full access to the features supported by Hue, which include switching the light on and off, changing the brightness, changing the colour, and various other features.

The Hue hardware used in the project are:
\begin{itemize}
\item HUE Hub - The bridge for connecting the other devices to the Internet. 
\item Light bulbs - Two light bulbs which can change colour. 
\end{itemize}










%Some of the existing solutions, as seen in \secref{sec:existing-solutions}, offered several starter packs each with a few \sdevs~and a \hub.
