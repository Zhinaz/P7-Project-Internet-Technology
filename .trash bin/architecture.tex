%\subsection{Complete Decentralisation}
%Making a complete decentralised solution would not be possible in this project. Complete decentralisation is characterised by having all logic, communication, and controlling functionality, implemented in all the \sdevs. This can also be achieved by using a peer-to-peer solution, where the application is distributed between all the devices, in order to decrease workloads and making all resources and functionality available for the other devices. 

%Benefits of using a decentralised system can be improvements to the stability. This could ensure, that if a central component breaks down, the system can redirect the signal around the faulty device, and still access the \sdevs~that would otherwise be inaccessible.
